 Code Quiz

MY Task
is to complete a coding assessmentâ€”perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. A timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
